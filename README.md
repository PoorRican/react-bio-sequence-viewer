# Introduction

Constructor is CAD for biology and biological function. The ability to create, manipulate and
optimize genetic data is geared for biologists, hobbyists, and experts alike via an intuitive UX, and it's
metabolism simulation removes the need for tedious experiments so that the user can focus on the end result -
whether it's industrial biosynthesis, medical application, for modifying wetware, or even just making a petri
dish glow-in-the-dark. All batteries are included.

## Features

- Import host genomes:
  - From public databases
  - Local file formats (ie: FASTx, SBML, tc)
- Create or import features such as genes, proteins, and metabolites
- View and edit metadata for host genomes and features
- Visualize, engineer, and verify cell metabolism
- Actuate design via gene synthesis or protocols (ie: CRISPR, Golden Gate, etc)
